# Community

OpenTelemetry community content.

## Communication

We are on [gitter](https://gitter.im/open-telemetry/community).

## Community Meetings
We host monthly community video conferences, alternating between times that work for Europe and Asia. These meetings are open to all contributors!

Meeting invites can be accessed from our public Calendar ([web](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=google.com_b79e3e90j7bbsa2n2p5an5lf60%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles), [gCal](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=Z29vZ2xlLmNvbV9iNzllM2U5MGo3YmJzYTJuMnA1YW41bGY2MEBncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t), [iCal](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/google.com_b79e3e90j7bbsa2n2p5an5lf60%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics)), and we keep public notes in the agenda document available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uvua6R-VnOpMmAjM3b7j3jQDFz6KHDzbEX4ZaZ9BFso).

## Special Interest Groups

We organize the community into Special Interest Groups (SIGs) in order to improve our workflow and more easily manage a community project.
